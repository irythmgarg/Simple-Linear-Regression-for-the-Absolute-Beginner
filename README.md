Simple Linear Regression Explained
Simple Linear Regression is a basic machine learning and statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables:

Independent Variable (X) – The predictor or input

Dependent Variable (Y) – The outcome or output

The goal is to find a straight line that best fits the data points, which can be represented by the equation:
Y=mX+b
where:
m = Slope of the line (how much Y changes for a unit change in X)
b = Intercept (value of Y when X=0)

Example:
If we want to predict a person’s salary (Y) based on their years of experience (X), a simple linear regression model could estimate:
Salary=5000×(Years of Experience)+30000
This means:

A person with 0 years of experience earns $30,000 (intercept).

For every extra year of experience, the salary increases by $5,000 (slope).

Key Points:
✅ Used when there's a linear relationship between two variables
✅ Helps in prediction and trend analysis
✅ Assumes no major outliers and constant variance in data
